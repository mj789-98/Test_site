# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## 🔴 Problem:

**Node.js Version Compatibility Issue**

- Netlify is using Node.js 22.18.0
- `@netlify/plugin-lighthouse` requires Node.js >=14.15 and <20
- Build fails due to version mismatch

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. **Created `.nvmrc` file:**

```
NODE_VERSION=18.20.4
```

- Specifies Node.js 18.20.4 (stable version compatible with Lighthouse plugin)
- This file tells Netlify which Node.js version to use

### 2. **Created `netlify.toml` configuration:**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.4"
```

- Explicitly sets Node.js version in Netlify config
- Configures build command and publish directory

### 3. **Updated `package.json`:**

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=14.15.0 <20.0.0",
  "npm": ">=6.0.0"
}
```

- Specifies compatible Node.js and npm versions
- Helps prevent future compatibility issues

## 🔧 **Next Steps for Deployment:**

### **Option 1: Simple Deployment (Recommended)**

1. **Commit your changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Node.js version for Netlify deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Netlify will automatically use the correct Node.js version

### **Option 2: Manual Netlify Configuration**

If you're already on Netlify:

1. **Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment**
2. **Add environment variable:**
   - Key: `NODE_VERSION`
   - Value: `18.20.4`
3. **Trigger new build**

## 🎯 **Why Node.js 18.20.4?**

- ✅ **Compatible** with @netlify/plugin-lighthouse (<20)
- ✅ **Modern features** - supports all your React/Vite features
- ✅ **LTS version** - Long Term Support, stable and secure
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - Great for your 3D portfolio

## 🔍 **Verification:**

After deployment, your build logs should show:

```
Node.js version: 18.20.4
Build successful!
```

## 🚨 **If Still Having Issues:**

### **Remove Lighthouse Plugin (Temporary):**

If the issue persists, you can temporarily remove the Lighthouse plugin:

1. **Remove from `netlify.toml`:**

   ```toml
   # Comment out or remove:
   # [[plugins]]
   #   package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use Lighthouse locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g lighthouse
   lighthouse https://your-deployed-site.netlify.app
   ```
